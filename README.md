## 🕹️ About the Game

Built with **React**, **GSAP**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a dash of creativity, **Bug Bash** challenges players to click on a fast-moving fly that appears randomly across the screen. It moves fast and just when you click on it right then it will fly away so, you have to be quick and slow to move racket to the fly.
⚠️ Miss the fly... and it might just buzz away mocking your slow reflexes!
